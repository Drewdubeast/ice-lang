class SemanticAnalyzer {
    //
    // Purpose of this class is to go through the file and make sure nothing is called/used
    // without being defined.
    //
    // Should catch:
    // -calling a variable or function that hasn't been defined should be caught here
    // -incorrect amount of arguments
    //
    
    // STEPS:
    // Do a walk over the AST and get variable names and function names
    // Do another walk through and make sure that any calls to the variable have values
    
    
    // Extra notes:
    // Any thing defined at the scope of the file level would just be at the top level - so do a first
    // walk through that just goes through the top level
    // Anything that is used deeper in a tree must have it declared before referenced in a function or anything
    //
    // Try parsing top level expressions first to get any declarations, and then parse deeper.
